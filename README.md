Your understanding is partially correct. Let me clarify the process step by step:

Reading Binary Data: Initially, we read the binary data from the file directly into memory without any encoding.

Creating JSON Payload: We then create a dictionary containing both text data (e.g., username, email, password) and binary data (e.g., image, video). We don't encode the binary data to Base64 at this stage. Instead, we keep it as raw binary data within the dictionary.

Converting to JSON: Next, we convert the dictionary containing both text and binary data to a JSON string using json.dumps(). This process serializes the dictionary into a JSON format string.
Sending the Request: We then send an HTTP POST request to the server with the JSON payload as the request body. When sending the request, the requests library internally encodes the JSON string to UTF-8 before sending it over the network. The binary data remains unchanged during this encoding process.

Server-side Handling: On the server side, the server receives the request and parses the JSON payload. The binary data remains in its original raw binary form within the JSON object. The server can then extract and handle the binary data as needed.

So, the key point to understand is that when including binary data in a JSON payload sent via an HTTP request, the binary data is kept as raw binary within the JSON object. It's the responsibility of the server to handle this binary data appropriately upon receiving the request. There's no need to encode the binary data to Base64 before sending it within the JSON payload unless the server expects it to be encoded that way.
